 * Classic 2Q algorithm from Johnson and Shasha
 *
 * Full version 2Q:
 *
 * On reclaiming for X:
 *  begin
 *      if there are free page slots then
 *          put X into a free page slot
 *      else if (|Alin| >Kin)
 *          page out the tail of Alin, call it Y
 *          add identifier of Y to the head of Alout
 *
 *          if (|Alout| >Kout)
 *              remove identifier of Z from the tail of Alout
 *          end if
 *
 *          put X into the reclaimed page slot
 *      else
 *          page out the tail of Am, call it Y
 *          // do not put it on Alout; it hasnâ€™t been accessed for a while
 *          put X into the reclaimed page slot
 *      end if
 *  end
 *
 *
 * On accessing:
 *  begin
 *      if X is in Am then
 *          move X to the head of Am
 *      else if (X is in Alout) then
 *          reclaim
 *          add X to the head of Am
 *      else if (X is in Alin)
 *          // do nothing
 *      else
 *          reclaim
 *          add X to the head of Alin
 *      end if
 *  end
 *
 * Modifications: objects are released on request only and in such a way that
 *                |A1in| and |Am| become as close to equal as possible.

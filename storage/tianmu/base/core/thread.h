/// \defgroup thread-module Seastar threads
/// Seastar threads provide an execution environment where blocking
/// is tolerated; you can issue I/O, and wait for it in the same function,
/// rather then establishing a callback to be called with \ref future<>::then().
///
/// Seastar threads are not the same as operating system threads:
///   - seastar threads are cooperative; they are never preempted except
///     at blocking points (see below)
///   - seastar threads always run on the same core they were launched on
///
/// Like other seastar code, seastar threads may not issue blocking system
/// calls.
///
/// A seastar thread blocking point is any function that returns a \ref
/// future<>. you block by calling \ref future<>::get(); this waits for the
/// future to become available, and in the meanwhile, other seastar threads and
/// seastar non-threaded code may execute.
///
/// Example:
/// \code
///    base::thread th([] {
///       sleep(5s).get();  // blocking point
///    });
/// \endcode
///
/// An easy way to launch a thread and carry out some computation, and return a
/// result from this execution is by using the \ref base::async() function.
/// The result is returned as a future, so that non-threaded code can wait for
/// the thread to terminate and yield a result.

/// This is a standard computer science condition variable sans locking,
/// since in seastar access to variables is atomic anyway, adapted
/// for futures.  You can wait for variable to be notified.
///
/// To support exceptional conditions, a \ref broken() method
/// is provided, which causes all current waiters to stop waiting,
/// with an exceptional future returned.  This allows causing all
/// fibers that are blocked on a condition variable to continue.
/// This issimilar to POSIX's `pthread_cancel()`, with \ref wait()
/// acting as a cancellation point.

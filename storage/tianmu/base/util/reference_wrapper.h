/// Wrapper for lvalue references
///
/// reference_wrapper wraps a lvalue reference into a copyable and assignable
/// object. It is very similar to std::reference_wrapper except that it doesn't
/// allow implicit construction from a reference and the only way to construct
/// it is to use either ref() or cref(). The reason for that discrepancy (and
/// also the reason why base::reference_wrapper was introduced) is that it
/// server different purpose than std::reference_wrapper. The latter protects
/// references from decaying and allows copying and assigning them.
/// base::reference_wrapper is used mainly to force user to explicitly
/// state that object is passed by reference thus reducing the chances that
/// the referred object being prematurely destroyed in case the execution
/// is deferred to a continuation.

   * There are two sides of join:
   * - "traversed", which is put partially (chunk by chunk) into the hash table,
   * - "matched", which is scanned completely for every chunk gathered in the
   * hash table.
   *
   * Algorithm:
   * 1. determine all traversed and matched dimensions,
   * 2. create hash table,
   * 3. traverse the main "traversed" dimension and put key values into the hash
   * table,
   * 4. put there also information about row numbers of all traversed dimensions
   *    (i.e. the main one and all already joined with it),
   * 5. scan the "matched" dimension, find the key values in the hash table,
   * 6. submit all the joined tuples as the result of join
   *    (take all needed tuple numbers from the hash table and "matched" part of
   * multiindex),
   * 7. if the "traversed" side was not fully scanned, clear hash table and go
   * to 4 with the next chunk.
